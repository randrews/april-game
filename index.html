<h1>Garden Defense</h1>

<p>A tower-defense game where you protect your flowers from bugs.</p>

<h2>Download:</h2>

<p>You can get the <a href="GardenDefense.love">L&ouml;ve file</a> or a <a href="GardenDefense-w32.zip">Windows build</a>.
  The L&ouml;ve version will work on any platform but requires you to install <a href="http://love2d.org">L&ouml;ve2d</a>.</p>

<h2>How to play:</h2>

<p>The goal of the game is simply to last as long as possible, and get as high a score as you can.
You earn points by having flowers survive to maturity, but bugs will try to eat them.</p>

<p>Flowers maturing will give you money, which you can use to build and upgrade towers (to shoot bugs), till plots (to plant more flowers), and
to spread insecticide (to slow down bugs).</p>

<p>Planting flowers requires seeds, but maturing flowers give you seeds. When you run out of seeds and flowers, you can
no longer earn points, so the game ends.</p>
